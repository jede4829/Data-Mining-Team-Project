## Description of the project

-----

We have created models that provide song recommendations and that predicate artist and song popularity.   In particular, the models predict artist and song popularity based on attributes of the artist and the song.  We collected the attributes from the Spotify API and, in turn, utilized statistical predictive analysis approaches to derive the attributes to discover patterns between the attributes and corresponding popularity.   For instance, we used the Apriori algorithm to generate attributes that appear frequently with one another and correspond to popularity of an artist or song.  This allowed us to create predictive music popularity models for song and artist popularity.  In addition, we also used statistical predictive analysis approaches to generate song and artist recommendations.

## Summary of the question(s) sought and the answers

-----

 - Discover the song characteristics most likely to contribute to a song’s or artist’s  popularity.
 - Predict song or artist popularity based on song or artist attributes.
 - Predict song or artist popularity based on popular genres.

-----

## Application of this knowledge

-----

 - With the use of the predictive music popularity models, the music industry can identify acoustic attributes that are correlated with music popularity. 
 - Create songs that include acoustic attributes correlated with popularity, i.e., loudness and energy. 
 - Sign artists that have characteristics associated with the acoustic attributes. 
 - The models can also be extended to create song recommendations based upon songs that contain similar attribute values.
